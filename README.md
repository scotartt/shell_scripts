# shell_scripts

This project is just a collection of useful shell scripts that I have written.

This is licenced to you with the GPL 3 licence. That means if you take these files you are obliged to publish and licence your now-open-source code as GPL 3 too. Feel free to borrow and modify. If you do what you think is a good modification, please return it to me (i.e. pull request).

Thanks.
Scot
